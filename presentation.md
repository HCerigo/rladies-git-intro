## Why learn git?
- version control
- üë≠ promotes collaboration
- üè≠ industry standard
- üí∏ free (and open source)

## Common Terms:
- **git / Github:** Github: github.com (ie a hosting service). Git is a tool/system for version control management. 
- **repository (repo):** directory or group of files
- **local / remote:** the copy of code on your machine vs the copy that is hosted 
- **pull request (pr):** a request to merge changes into a different branch
- **diff:** the changes made from one version compared to another
- **master:** default branch 
- **branch:** a copy of the repository which you can diff against the master branch
- **fork / clone** Cloning is still connected to the original remote. Forking makes a copy so a full copy of the repo with a new master branch is saved under your username. 

## Basic commands
- `git checkout -b` 
- `git status`
